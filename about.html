<p>I'm a software software developer living in Perth, Australia. I've been writing software professionally since 1999, almost exclusively in the Microsoft stack (with a little Java and Oracle thrown in over the years). I've started this blog to capture a few of my random thoughts on software development and to comment on the progress of a few of my personal projects - <a href="cycle-with.me">cycle-with.me</a> and 
<a href="http://antmeehan.com/FeatureToggle/">FeatureToggle</a>.</p>
