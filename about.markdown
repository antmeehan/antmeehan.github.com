I'm a software software developer living in Perth, Australia. I've been writing software professionally since 1999, almost exclusively in the Microsoft stack (with a little Java and Oracle thrown in over the years). I've started this blog to capture a few of my random thoughts on software development and to comment on the progress of a few of my personal projects - [cycle-with.me](https://cycle-with.me) and [FeatureVersioning](https://antmeehan.com/FeatureVersioning).
