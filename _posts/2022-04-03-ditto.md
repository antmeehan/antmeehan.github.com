When I build a fresh development workstation there are always two commands I start with:

1. [Install chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
2. `choco install ditto`

What is *ditto*? To quote their [own description](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/):

> Ditto is an extension to the standard windows clipboard. It saves each item placed on the clipboard allowing you access to any of those items at a later time. Ditto allows you to save any type of information that can be put on the clipboard, text, images, html, custom formats, .....

But I don't think those words do it justice. I've been an avid ditto user for almost a decade and I can't imagine using a PC without it. "It's just a clipboard manager!" you say? That is correct - it is a clipboard manager, but it has **so** many features that make it such as rich tool it brings real improvement to your workflows using a PC.

The other week I kept sending more and more ditto tips to my colleague as I was using different features day-to-day. And then I remembered the wise words of Scott Hanselman, so I'm going [blog about them instead](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes). ðŸ˜€
